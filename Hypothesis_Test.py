# significance value = alpha (decided by domain expert)
# Confidence interval CI based on aplha value/
# perform p value based on statistical analysis
# if p value falls in CI region then accept H0 (null hypothesis)
# if p value is outside of CI region the we will reject H0, and accept alternate hypothesis H1.
# p value is outcome of statistical experiment and aplha value is given by domain expert

# Type of Tests
# Z Test Comparison of Mean
# T Test: Comparison of Mean
